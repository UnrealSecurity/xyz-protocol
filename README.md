# Xyz Network Message Protocol
Xyz library is currently only available for C#. All messages are automatically compressed with Deflate before sending and decompressed upon receiving. Comes with all the things you need to establish a secure connection between two connected parties. Key exchange isn't built in but it's super easy to implement your own key exchange using XyzKeyExchange.
